## About

This repository contains my course scripts and materials for the Johns Hopkins 
Data Science specialization in Coursera.

The specialization consisted of nine courses plus a final capstone project
involving natural language processing (NLP). The code here represents my
solutions to the various course projects and capstone. If you are taking the
course, please do not copy my solutions.

## Scripts

Most of the solutions utilize the R programming language, and are often
written as R Markdown (Rmd) documents.
